Breakdown:

Libraries need to install:         
1. streamlit- To build the web application UI.
2. pandas-For working with the movie dataset (movies['title'] etc).
3. numpy-(Likely used in Movie_Recomendation_Project.ipynb to compute similarity.)
4. scikit-learn-(Likely used to compute similarity matrix using TF-IDF or cosine similarity.)
5. pickle-(Built-in) Used to load the .pkl files (movie_list.pkl, similarity.pkl)


Libraries used:
